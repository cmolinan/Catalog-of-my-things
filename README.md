## Catalog-Of-My-Things

#### Description

> In this project, we created a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you won: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything based on the UML class diagram. The data stored in JSON files but we also prepared a database with tables structure analogical to our program's classes structure.
